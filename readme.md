# Canadian Address Cleanning Python Package (ADC) 
<p align="justify">
A spatial data cleaning package specially tailored for Canadian addresses. You might notice that there could be so many kinds of data input errors, such as missing postcode, misspelled street name, misspelled city name, and different types of abbreviations in the address column. It could quickly become a nightmare if we do not clean and standardize these raw address data. Dont worry! This package will help you standardize, autocorrect, and validate address data.
